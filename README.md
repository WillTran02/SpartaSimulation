# SpartaSimulation
Creating a simulation for sparta global intake

Sparta Global is a business that recruits trainees into their academy, trains them up as Spartans, then deploys them to third-party clients who need tech specialists in development, testing and analysis.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, the need for tech specialists sky-rocketed, and with it Sparta's need to intake many more trainees to fill those roles.

This program is designed to simulate that increase of trainees versus Sparta's capacity to build new training centres and intake new trainees.

The current version of the program generates a random number of trainees every month, and a new centre every two months. It then proceeds to make every centre perform an intake of a random number of trainees. Everyone who doesn't make it into a training centre will be put onto a priority waiting list, from which centres will prioritize their intake from the following month.

# How to use the program

- Navigate to SpartaProject/src/main/java/com/sparta/
- Run the App.java file
- The program should ask you to enter a number of months. Please enter a number greater than or equal to 12 (1 year).
- The program should ask you to enter an option to choose how you wish the report to be displayed. Please enter "A" or "B" (case insensitive).
- The program will run the simulation and deliver your report for that session to the screen.
- At this point, the program will ask if you would like to run a new simulation or not. Please enter "Y" for yes, or "N" for no, which terminates the program.
